2. [ORDER] [BY]

7. [GLOB] Unlike the LIKE operator, the GLOB operator is case sensitive and uses the UNIX wildcards. In addition, the GLOB patterns do not have escape characters.
```SQL
SELECT

	tracks
WHERE
    name GLOB 'Man*';

SELECT
	trackid,
	name

WHERE
    name GLOB '?ere*';

SELECT
	trackid,
	name
FROM
	tracks
WHERE
    name GLOB '*[1-9]*';    

SELECT
	trackid,
	name
FROM
	tracks
WHERE
	name GLOB '*[^1-9]*';
```

8.[IS] [NULL] 
The following statement attempts to find tracks whose composers are NULL:
```SQL
SELECT
    Name, 
    Composer
FROM
    tracks
WHERE
    Composer = NULL;

```
It returns an empty row without issuing any additional message.
To check if a value is NULL or not, you use the IS NULL operator instead:
{ column | expression } IS NULL;


```SQL
SELECT
    Name, 
    Composer
FROM
    tracks
WHERE
    Composer IS NULL
ORDER BY 
    Name;   

SELECT
    Name, 
    Composer
FROM
    tracks
WHERE
    Composer IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY 
    Name;
